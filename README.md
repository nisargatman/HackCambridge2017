People throw receipts they get from all kinds of shops every day.

This is wasteful of paper, resources and time.

This project is a way to digitalise all receipts - all the user needs is a phone and we provide the app!

Features:  
1. Scan receipts and save them to your phone.  
2. Get receipts sent directly to your phone.  
3. Get insights and analytics on your spending patterns!
